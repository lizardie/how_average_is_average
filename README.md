# How average is average? - supplementary materials

Supplementary materials for the article [_"How average is average? Temporal patterns in human behaviour as measured by mobile phone data – or why chose Thursdays."_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00137) include:

* File `ReadMe_VariableList.csv` containing the list of variables and description.
* File `MIND_hourly_data.csv` containing the data necessary to reproduce the article results.

The dataset enables replication of the analysis used in the article _"How average is average? Temporal patterns in human behaviour as measured by mobile phone data – or why chose Thursdays"_. It contains the metadata about the mobile phone dataset MIND (standardised file sizes) and additional data we used in the article.

Due to the agreement with the data providing mobile phone company, we cannot share the raw data for the mobile phones. Moreover, this would be impractical in principle, as the raw dataset size already is larger than 40 TB and is growing. However, we do provide all the data necessary for analysis - the metadata (standardised file sizes) and the weather and events data.
