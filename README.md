# How average is average? - supplementary materials

Supplementary materials for the article [_"How average is average? Temporal patterns in human behaviour as measured by mobile phone data â€“ or why chose Thursdays."_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00137) include:
* File `ReadMe_VariableList.csv` containing the list of variables and description.
* File `MIND_hourly_data.csv` containing the data necessary to reproduce the article results.

## Data restrictions
Due to the agreement with the data providing mobile phone company, we cannot provide the raw data for the mobile phones. Moreover, this would be impractical in principle, as the raw dataset size already is larger than 40 TB and is growing. However, we do provide the dataset that enables replication of the analysis, which contains the metadata we used for the analysis (standardized file sizes) and additional data we used (weather and events). Thus, in principle we provide all the data necessary for analysis.
